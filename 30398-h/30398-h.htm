<p>&#9632; When he felt the sudden sharp tingling
on his skin which came from
the alarm device under his wrist
watch, Dr. Halder Leorm turned unhurriedly
from the culture tray he
was studying, walked past the laboratory
technician to the radiation room,
entered it and closed the door behind
him. He slipped the instrument
from his wrist, removed its back
plate, and held it up to his eye.</p>

<p>He was looking into the living
room of his home, fifty miles away in
another section of Orado's great city
of Draise. A few steps from the entry,
a man lay on his back on the
carpeting, eyes shut, face deeply
flushed, apparently unconscious. Halder
Leorm's mouth tightened. The
man on the carpet was Dr. Atteo, his
new assistant, assigned to the laboratory
earlier in the week. Beyond
Atteo, the entry from the residence's
delivery area and car port stood open.</p>

<p>Fingering the rim of the tiny
scanner with practiced quickness,
Halder Leorm shifted the view to
other sections of the house, finally to
the car port. An empty aircar stood
in the port; there was no one in
sight.</p>

<p>Halder sighed, replaced the instrument
on his wrist, and glanced
over at a wall mirror. His face was
pale but looked sufficiently composed.
Leaving the radiation room, he
picked up his hat, said to the technician,
"Forgot to mention it, Reef,
but I'll have to head over to central
laboratories again."</p>

<div class="figr" style="width: 365px;"><img src="images/001.png" width="365" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Reef, a large, red-headed young
man, glanced around in mild surprise.
"They've got a nerve, calling
you across town every two days!" he
observed. "Whose problem are you
supposed to solve now?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't informed. Apparently,
something urgent has come up and
they want my opinion on it."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I bet!" Reef scratched his
head, glanced along the rows of culture
trays. "Well ... nothing here at
the moment I can't handle, even if
Atteo doesn't show up. Will you be
back before evening?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't count on it," Halder
said. "You know how those conferences
tend to go."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. Well, Dr. Leorm, if I
don't see you before tomorrow, give
my love to your beautiful wife."</p>

<p>Halder smiled back at him from
the door. "Will do, Reef!" He let the
door slide shut behind him, started
towards the exit level of the huge
pharmaceutical plant. Reef had acted
in a completely normal manner. If, as
seemed very probable, "Dr. Atteo"
was a Federation agent engaged in
investigating Dr. Halder Leorm, Halder's
co-workers evidently had not
been apprised of the fact. Still, Halder
thought, he must warn Kilby instantly.
It was quite possible that an
attempt to arrest him would be made
before he left the building.</p>

<p>He stepped into the first ComWeb
booth on his route, and dialed Kilby's
business number. His wife had a
desk job in one of the major fashion
stores in the residential section of
Draise, and&mdash;which was fortunate
just now&mdash;a private office. Her face
appeared almost immediately on the
screen before him, a young face, soft-looking,
with large, gray eyes. She
smiled in pleased surprise. "'Lo,
Halder!"</p>

<p>"'Lo, Kilby.... Did you forget?"</p>

<p>Kilby's smile became inquiring.
"Forget what?"</p>

<p>"That we're lunching together at
Hasmin's today."</p>

<p>Halder paused, watching the color
drain quickly from Kilby's cheeks.</p>

<p>"Of course!" she whispered. "I did
forget. Got tied up in ... and ... I'll
leave right now! All right?"</p>

<p>Halder smiled. She was past the
first moment of shock and would be
able to handle herself. After all, they
had made very precise preparations
against the day when they might discover
that the Federation's suspicions
had turned, however tentatively, in
their direction.</p>

<p>"That'll be fine," he said. "I'm calling
from the lab and will leave at
once"&mdash;he paused almost imperceptibly&mdash;"if
I'm not held up. Meet you at
Hasmin's, in any case, in around
twenty minutes."</p>

<p>Kilby's eyes flickered for an instant.
If Halder didn't make it away,
she was to carry out her own escape,
as planned. That was the understanding.
She gave him a tremulous smile.
"And I'm forgiven?"</p>

<p>"Of course." Halder smiled back.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">The guards at the check-out point
were not men he knew, but Halder
walked through the ID-scanning
band without incident, apparently
without arousing interest. Beyond, to
the left, was a wide one-way portal to
a tube station. His aircar was in the
executive parking area on the building's
roof, but the escape plan called
for both of them to abandon their private
cars, which were more than likely
to be traps, and use the public
transportation systems in starting out.</p>

<p>Halder entered the tube station,
went to a rented locker, opened it
and took out two packages, one containing
a complete change of clothing
and a mirror, the other half a dozen
canned cultures of as many varieties
of microlife&mdash;highly specialized
strains of life, of which the pharmaceutical
concern that employed Dr.
Halder Leorm knew no more than it
did of the methods by which they had
been developed.</p>

<p>Halder carried the packages into a
ComWeb booth which he locked and
shielded for privacy. Then he opened
both packages and quickly removed
his clothing. Opening the first of the
cultures, he dipped one of the needles
into it and, watching himself in the
mirror, made a carefully measured injection
in each side of his face. He
laid the needle down and opened the
next container, aware of the enzyme
reaction that had begun to race
through him.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, the mirror
showed him a dark-skinned stranger
with high cheek bones, heavy jaw,
thick nose, slightly slanted eyes, graying
hair. Halder disposed of the mirror,
the clothes he had been wearing
and the remaining contents of the
second package. Unchecked, the alien
organisms swarming in his blood
stream now would have gone on to
destroy him in a variety of unpleasant
ways. But with their work of disguise
completed, they were being checked.</p>

<p>He emerged presently from a tube
exit in uptown Draise, on the terrace
of a hotel forty stories above the
street level. He didn't look about for
Kilby, or rather the woman Kilby
would turn into on her way here. The
plan called for him to arrive first, to
make sure he hadn't been traced, and
then to see whether she was being
followed.</p>

<p>She appeared five minutes later, a
slightly stocky lady now, perhaps ten
years under Halder's present apparent
age, dark-skinned as he was, showing
similar racial characteristics. She
flashed her teeth at him as she came
up, sloe eyes flirting.</p>

<p>"Didn't keep you waiting, did I?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Halder growled amiably, "What do
you think? Let's grab a cab and get
going." Nobody had come out of the
tube exit behind her.</p>

<p>Kilby nodded understandingly; she
had remembered not to look back.
She was talking volubly about some
imaginary adventure as they started
down the terrace stairs towards a line
of aircabs, playing her part, high-piled
golden hairdo bobbing about. A
greater contrast to the slender, quiet,
gray-eyed girl, brown hair falling
softly to her shoulders, with whom
Halder had talked not more than
twenty minutes ago would have been
difficult to devise. The disguises
might have been good enough, he
thought, to permit them to remain
undetected in Draise itself.</p>

<p>But the plan didn't call for that.
There were too many things at stake.</p>

<p>Kilby slipped into the cab ahead of
him without a break in her chatter.</p>

<p>Her voice stopped abruptly as
Halder closed the cab door behind
him, activating the vehicle's one-way
vision shield. Kilby was leaning
across the front seat beside the driver,
turning off the comm box. She
straightened, dropped down into the
back seat beside Halder, biting her
lip. The driver's head sagged sideways
as if he had fallen asleep; then
he slid slowly down on the seat and
vanished from Halder's sight.</p>

<p>"Got him instantly, eh?" Halder
asked, switching on the passenger
controls.</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m!" Kilby opened her
purse, slipped the little gun which
had been in the palm of her left hand
into it, reached out and gripped Halder's
hand for an instant. "You drive,
Halder," she said. "I'm so nervous I
could scream! I'm scared cold! What
happened?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Halder lifted the cab out from the
terrace, swung it skywards. "We were
right in wondering about Dr. Atteo,"
he said. "Half an hour ago, he attempted
to go through our home in
our absence. We'll have to assume
he's a Federation agent. The entry
trap knocked him out, but the fat's
probably in the fire now. The Federation
may not have been ready to
make an arrest yet, but after this
there'll be no hesitation. We'll have
to move fast if we intend to keep
ahead of Atteo's colleagues."</p>

<p>Kilby drew in an unsteady breath.
"You warned Rane and Santin?"</p>

<p>Halder nodded. "I sent the alert
signal to their apartment ComWeb in
the capital. Under the circumstances,
I didn't think a person-to-person call
would be advisable. They'll have time
to pack and get out to the ranch before
we arrive. We'll give them the
details then."</p>

<p>"Did you reset the trap switch at
the house entry?"</p>

<p>Halder slowed the cab, turning it
into one of the cross-city traffic lines
above Draise. "No," he said. "Knocking
out a few more Federation agents
wouldn't give us any advantage. It'll
be eight or nine hours before Atteo
will be able to talk; and, with any
luck at all, we'll be clear of the planet
by that time."</p>

<p>The dark woman who was Kilby
and a controlled devil's swarm of
microlife looked over at him and
asked in Kilby's voice, "Halder, do
you think we should still go on trying
to find the others now?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Why stop?"</p>

<p>Kilby hesitated, said, "It took you
three months to find me. Four months
later, we located Rane Rellis ... and
Santin, at almost the same time.
Since then we've drawn one blank
after another. A year and a half gone,
and a year and a half left."</p>

<p>She paused, and Halder said nothing,
knowing she was fighting to
keep her voice steady. After a few
seconds, Kilby went on. "Almost
twelve hundred still to find, scattered
over a thousand worlds. Most of
them probably in hiding, as we were.
And with the Federation on our
trail ... even if we get away this time,
what chance is there now of contacting
the whole group before time
runs out?"</p>

<p>Halder said patiently, "It's not an
impossibility. We've been forced to
spend most of the past year and a
half gathering information, studying
the intricate functioning of this gigantic
civilization&mdash;so many things
that our mentors on Kalechi either
weren't aware of or chose not to tell
us. And we haven't done too badly,
Kilby. We're prepared now to conduct
the search for the group in a
methodical manner. Nineteen hours
in space, and we'll be on another
world, under cover again, with new
identities. Why shouldn't we continue
with the plan until ..."</p>

<p>Kilby interrupted without change
of expression. "Until we hear some
day that billions of human beings are
dying on the Federation's worlds?"</p>

<p>Halder kept his eyes fixed on the
traffic pattern ahead. "It won't come
to that," he said.</p>

<p>"Won't it? How can you be sure?"
Kilby asked tonelessly.</p>

<p>"Well," Halder asked, "what else
can we do? You aren't suggesting
that we give ourselves up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've thought of it."</p>

<p>"And be picked apart mentally
and physically in the Federation's
laboratories?" Halder shook his head.
"In their eyes we'd be Kalechi's creatures
... monsters. Even if we turn
ourselves in, they'll think it's some
trick, that we'd realized we'd get
caught anyway. We couldn't expect
much mercy. No, if everything fails,
we'll see to it that the Federation gets
adequate warning. But not, if we can
avoid it, at the expense of our own
lives." He glanced over at her, his
eyes troubled. "We've been over this
before, Kilby."</p>

<p>"I know." Kilby bit her lip.
"You're right, I suppose."</p>

<p>Halder let the cab glide out of the
traffic lane, swung it around towards
the top of a tall building three miles
to their left. "We'll be at the club in
a couple of minutes," he said. "If
you're too disturbed, it would be
better if you stayed in the car. I'll
pick up our flighthiking outfits and
we can take the cab on to the city limits
before we dismiss it."</p>

<p>Kilby shook her head. "We agreed
we shouldn't change any details of
the escape plan unless it was absolutely
necessary. I'll straighten out.
I've just let this situation shake me
too much."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">They set the aircab to traffic-safe
random cruise control before getting
out of it at their club. It lifted quietly
into the air again as soon as the door
had closed, was out of sight beyond
the building before they reached the
club entrance. The driver's records
had indicated that his shift would end
in three hours. Until that time he
would not be missed. More hours
would pass after the cab was located
before the man returned to consciousness.
What he had to say then
would make no difference.</p>

<p>In one of the club rooms, rented to
a Mr. and Mrs. Anley, they changed
to shorts and flighthiking equipment,
then took a tube to the outskirts of
Draise where vehicleless flight became
possible. Forest parks interspersed
with small residential centers
stretched away to the east. They
set their flight harnesses to Draise's
power broadcast system, moved up
fifty feet and floated off into the
woods, energizing drive and direction
units with the measured stroking motion
which made flighthiking one of
the most relaxing and enjoyable of
sports. And one&mdash;so Halder had theorized&mdash;which
would be considered
an improbable occupation for a couple
attempting to escape from the
Federation's man-hunting systems.</p>

<p>For an hour and a half, they held a
steady course eastwards, following
the contours of the rolling forested
ground, rarely emerging into the
open. Other groups of vehicleless
fliers passed occasionally; as members
of a sporting fraternity, they exchanged
waves and shouted greetings.
At last, a long, wild valley
opened ahead, showing no trace of
human habitation; at its far end began
open land, dotted with small tobacco
farms where automatic cultivators
moved unhurriedly about.
Kilby, glancing back over her shoulder
at Halder for a moment, swung
around towards one of the farms,
gliding down close to the ground,
Halder twenty feet behind her. They
settled down beside a hedge at the
foot of a slope covered with tobacco
plants. A small gate in the hedge immediately
swung open.</p>

<p>"All clear here, folks!" a voice
curiously similar to Halder's addressed
them from the gate speaker.</p>

<div class="figl"><img src="images/002.png" width="220" height="350" alt="" title="" /></div>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/003.png" width="221" height="350" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Rane Rellis, a lanky, red-headed
man with a wide-boned face, was
striding down the slope towards them
as they moved through the gate. "We
got your alert," he said, "but as it
happens, we'd already realized that
something had gone wrong."</p>

<p>Kilby gave him a startled glance.
"Somebody has been checking on
you, too?"</p>

<p>"Not that ... at least as far as we
know. Come on up to the shed. Santin's
already inside the mountain."
As they started along the narrow
path between the rows of plants,
Rellis went on, "The first responses
to our inquiries came in today. One
of them looked very promising.
Santin flew her car to Draise immediately
to inform you about it.
She scanned your home as usual before
calling, discovered three strange
men waiting inside."</p>

<p>"When was this?" Halder interrupted.</p>

<p>"A few minutes after one o'clock.
Santin checked at once at your place
of work and Kilby's, learned you
both were absent, deduced you were
still at large and probably on your
way here. She called to tell me about
it. Your alert signal sounded almost
before she'd finished talking."</p>

<p>Halder glanced at Kilby. "We
seem to have escaped arrest by something
like five minutes," he remarked
dryly. "Were you able to
bring the records with you, Rane?"</p>

<p>"Yes, everything. If we get clear of
Orado, we can pick up almost where
we left off." Rane Rellis swung the
door of the cultivator shed open and
followed them in, closing and locking
the door behind him. They crossed
quickly through the small building to
an open wall portal at the far end.
Beyond the portal a large, brightly lit
room was visible, comfortably furnished,
windowless. Between that
room and the shed the portal spanned
a distance of seven miles, a vital
point in the organization of their escape
route. If they were traced this
far, the trail would end&mdash;temporarily,
at least&mdash;at the ranch.</p>

<p>They stepped over into the room,
and Rane Rellis pulled down a
switch. Behind them the portal entry
vanished. Back in the deserted ranch
building, its mechanisms were bursting
into flames, would burn fiercely
for a few seconds and fuse to dead
slag.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Rane said tightly, "I feel a little
better now ... just a little! The Fed
agents are good, but I haven't yet
heard of detection devices that could
drive through five hundred yards of
solid rock to spot us inside a mountain."
He paused as a tall girl with
black hair, dark-brown eyes, came in
from an adjoining room. Santin Rellis
was the only one of the four who was
not employing a biological disguise at
the moment. In spite of the differences
in their appearance, she might
have been taken for Kilby's sister.</p>

<p>Halder told them what had occurred
in Draise, concluded, "I'd believed
that suspicion was more likely
to center first on one of you. Particularly,
of course, on Santin, working
openly in Orado's Identification Center."</p>

<p>Santin grinned. "And, less openly,
copying out identity-patterns!" she
added. Her face sobered quickly
again. "There's no indication of what
did attract attention to you?"</p>

<p>Halder shook his head. "I can only
think it's the microbiological work
I've been doing. That, of course,
would suggest that they already have
an inkling of Kalechi's three-year
plan to destroy the Federation."</p>

<p>Rane added, "And that at least one
of the group already has been captured!"</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment.
Santin said evenly, "That isn't a
pleasant thought. Halder, everything
we've learned recently at the Identification
Center indicates that Rane's
theory is correct ... every one of the
twelve hundred members of the
Kalechi group probably can be analyzed
down to the same three basic
identity-patterns, reshuffled in endless
variation. The Federation wouldn't
have to capture many of us before
discovering the fact. It will then
start doing exactly what we're trying
to do&mdash;use it to identify the rest of
the group."</p>

<p>Halder nodded. "I've thought of
that."</p>

<p>"You still intend to use the Senla
Starlight Cruisers to get out into
space?" Rane asked.</p>

<p>"Kilby and I will," Halder said.
"But now, of course, you two had better
select one of the alternate escape
routes."</p>

<p>"Why that?" Santin asked sharply.</p>

<p>Halder looked at her. "That's obvious,
isn't it? There's a good chance
you're still completely in the clear."</p>

<p>"That's possible. But it isn't a good
enough reason for splitting up. We're
a working team, and we should stay
together, regardless of circumstances.
What do you say, Rane?"</p>

<p>Her husband said, "I agree with
you." He smiled briefly at Halder.
"We'll be waiting for you on the
north shore of Lake Senla ten minutes
before the Starlight Cruise lifts.
Now, is there anything else to discuss?"</p>

<p>"Not at the moment." Halder
paused, dissatisfied, then went on.
"All right. We still don't know just
what the Federation is capable of ...
one move might as easily be wrong as
the other. We'll pick you up, as arranged.
Kilby and I are flighthiking
on to Senla, so we might as well start
immediately."</p>

<p>They went into the second room of
the underground hideout. Rane
turned to the exit portal's controls,
asked, "Where shall I let you out?"</p>

<p>"We'll take the river exit," Halder
said. "Six miles from here, nine from
the ranch ... that should be far
enough. We'll be lost in an army of
vacationers from Draise and the capital
thirty seconds after we emerge."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">It was dusk when Halder and Kilby
turned into the crowded shore walk
of the lake resort of Senla, moving
unhurriedly towards a bungalow Halder
had bought under another name
some months before. Halder's
thoughts went again over the details
of the final stage of their escape from
Orado. Essentially, the plan was simple.
An hour from now they would
slide their small star cruiser out of the
bungalow's yacht stall, pick up Rane
and Santin on the far shore of the
lake, then join the group of thirty or
so private yachts which left the resort
area nightly for a two-hour flight
to a casino ship stationed off the
planet. A group cruise was unlikely
to draw official scrutiny even tonight;
and after reaching the casino, they
should be able to slip on unobserved
into space.</p>

<p>There was, however, no way of
knowing with certainty that the plan
... or any other plan ... would work.
It was only during the past few
months that the four of them had
begun to understand in detail the extent
to which the vast, apparently
loose complex of the Federation's
worlds was actually organized. How
long they had been under observation,
how much the Federation suspected
or knew about them&mdash;those
questions were, at the moment, unanswerable.
So Halder walked on in
alert silence, giving his attention to
anything which might be a first indication
of danger in the crowds surging
quietly past them along Senla's
shore promenade in the summer evening.
It was near the peak of the
resort's season; a sense of ease and
relaxation came from the people he
passed, their voices seeming to blend
into a single, low-pitched, friendly
murmur. Well, and in time, Halder
told himself, if everything went well,
he and Kilby might be able to mingle
undisguised, unafraid, with just such
a crowd. But tonight they were
hunted.</p>

<p>He laid his hand lightly on Kilby's
arm, said, "Let's rest on that bench
over there for a moment."</p>

<p>She smiled up at him, said, "All
right," turned and led the way towards
an unoccupied bench set back
among the trees above the walk.
They sat down, and Halder quickly
slipped the watch off his wrist and removed
the scanner's cover plate. The
bungalow was a few hundred yards
away now, on a side path which led
down to the lake. It was showing no
lights, but as the scanner reached into
it, invisible radiation flooded the
dark rooms and hallway, disclosing
them to the instrument's inspection.
For two or three minutes, Halder
studied the bungalow's interior carefully;
then he shifted the view to the
grounds outside, finally to the yacht
stall and the little star cruiser. Twice
Kilby touched him warningly as
somebody appeared about to approach
the bench, and Halder put down his
hand. But the strangers went by without
pausing.</p>

<p>At last, he replaced the instrument
on his wrist. He had discovered no
signs of intrusion in the bungalow;
and, at any rate, it was clear that no
one was waiting there now, either in
the little house itself or in the immediate
vicinity. He stood up, and
put out his hand to assist Kilby to her
feet.</p>

<p>"We'll go on," he said.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, they came
along a narrow garden path to the
bungalow's dark side entrance. There
was to be no indication tonight that
the bungalow had occupants. Halder
unlocked the door quietly, and after
Kilby had slipped inside, he stepped
in behind her and secured the door.</p>

<p>For an instant, as they moved along
the short, lightless passage to the
front rooms, a curious sensation
touched Halder&mdash;a terrifying conviction
that some undefinable thing had
just gone wrong. And with that, his
whole body was suddenly rigid,
every muscle locking in mid-motion.
He felt momentum topple him slowly
forwards; then he was no longer falling
but stopped, tilted off-balance at
a grotesque angle, suspended in a
web of forces he could not feel. Not
the slightest sound had come from
Kilby, invisible in the blackness
ahead of him.</p>

<p>Halder threw all his will and
strength into the effort to force motion
back into his body. Instead, a
wave of cold numbness washed slowly
up through him. It welled into his
brain, and for a time all thought and
sensation ended.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">His first new awareness was a feeling
of being asleep and not knowing
how to wake up. There was no disturbance
associated with it. All about
was darkness, complete and quiet.</p>

<p>With curious deliberation, Halder's
senses now began bringing other
things to his attention. He was
seated, half reclining, in a deep and
comfortable chair, his back against it.
He seemed unable to move. His
arms were secured in some manner
to the chair's armrests; but, beyond
that, he also found it impossible to
lift his body forwards or, he discovered
next, to turn his head in any direction.
He was breathing normally,
and he could open and shut his eyes
and glance about in unchanging darkness.
But that was all.</p>

<p>Still with a dreamlike lack of concern,
Halder began to ask himself
what had happened; and in that instant,
with a rush of hot terror, his
memory opened out. They had been
trapped ... some undetectable trick
of Federation science had waited for
them in the bungalow at Lake Senla.
He had been taken somewhere else.</p>

<p>What had they done with Kilby?</p>

<p>Immediately, almost as if in answer
to his question, the darkness
seemed to lighten. But the process
was gradual; seconds passed before
Halder gained the impression of a
very large room of indefinite proportions.
Twenty feet away was the rim
of a black, circular depression in the
flooring. At first, his chair seemed the
only piece of furnishing here; then,
as the area continued to brighten,
Halder became aware of several objects
at some distance on his right.</p>

<p>For an instant, he strained violently
to turn his head towards them.
That was still impossible, but the objects
were there, near the edge of his
vision. Again the great room grew
lighter, and for seconds Halder could
distinguish three armchairs like his
own, spaced perhaps twenty feet apart
along the rim of the central pit. Each
chair had an occupant; in the nearest
was Kilby, restored to her natural appearance,
motionless, pale face turned
forwards, eyes open. Suddenly the
light vanished.</p>

<p>Halder sat shocked, realizing he
had tried to speak to Kilby and that
no sound had come from his throat.
Neither speech nor motion was allowed
them here. But he didn't doubt
that Kilby was awake, or that Santin
and Rane Rellis were in the farther
chairs, though he hadn't seen either
of them clearly. Their captors had
given them a brief glimpse of one
another, perhaps to let them know all
had been caught. Then, as the light
disappeared, Halder's glance had
shifted for an instant to his right hand
lying on the armrest&mdash;long enough to
see that the dark tinge was gone from
his skin, as it was from Kilby's, that
he, too, had been deprived of the organisms
which disguised him.</p>

<p>And that, his studies in Draise had
showed clearly, was something the
Federation's science would be a century
away from knowing how to do
unless it learned about Kalechi's
deadly skills.</p>

<p>Once more, it was almost as if the
thought were being given an answer.
In the darkness of the room a bright
image appeared, three-dimensional,
not quite a sphere in form, tiger-striped
in orange and black, balanced
on a broad, bifurcated swimming tail.
Stalked eyes protruded from the top
of the sphere; their slit pupils
seemed to be staring directly at Halder.
Down both sides ran a row of
ropy arms.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Simultaneously with the appearance
of this projection, a man's voice began
to speak, not loudly but distinctly.
Dreamlike again, the voice seemed
to have no specific source, as if it
were coming from every direction at
once; and a numbing conviction arose
in Halder that their minds were being
destroyed in this room, that a
methodical dissecting process had
begun which would continue move
by move and hour by hour until the
Federation's scientists were satisfied
that no further scraps of information
could be drained from the prisoners.
The investigation might be completely
impersonal; but the fact that
they were being ignored here as
sentient beings, were not permitted
to argue their case or offer an explanation,
seemed more chilling than
deliberate brutality. And yet, Halder
told himself, he couldn't really blame
anyone for the situation they were in.
The Kalechi group represented an
urgent and terrible threat. The Federation
could not afford to make any
mistakes in dealing with it.</p>

<p>"This image," the voice was saying,
"represents a Great Satog, the oxygen-breathing,
water-dwelling native
of the world of Kalechi. There are
numerous type-variations of the species.
Shown here is the dominant
form. It is highly intelligent; approximately
a third of a Satog's body
space is occupied by its brain.</p>

<p>"Kalechi's civilization is based on
an understanding of biological processes
and the means of their manipulation
which is well in advance of
our own. This specialized interest
appears to have developed from the
Satogs' genetic instability, a factor
which they have learned to control
and to use to their advantage. At
present, they have established themselves
on at least a dozen other
worlds, existing on each in a modified
form which is completely adapted to
the new environment.</p>

<p>"Our occasional contacts with Kalechi
and its colonies during the past
two centuries have been superficially
friendly, but it appears now that the
Great Satogs have regarded our technological
and numerical superiority
with alarm and have cast about for a
method to destroy the Federation
without risk to themselves. A weapon
was on hand&mdash;their great skill and experience
in altering genetic patterns
in established life forms to produce
desired changes. They devised the
plan of distributing Kalechi agents
secretly throughout the Federation.
These were to develop and store specific
strains of primitive organisms
which, at an indicated later date,
would sweep our major worlds simultaneously
with an unparalleled storm
of plagues.</p>

<p>"The most audacious part of the
Kalechi scheme follows. Ninety-two
years ago, a Federation survey ship
disappeared in that sector of the
galaxy. Aboard it was a man named
Ohl Cantrall, an outstanding scientist
of the period. We know now that this
ship was captured by the Great
Satogs, and that Cantrall, his staff, and
his crew, were subjected to extensive
experimentation by them, and eventually
were killed.</p>

<p>"The experimentation had been designed
to provide Kalechi's master-biologists
with models towards which
to work. They proposed to utilize the
high mutability of their species to develop
a Satog type that would be the
exact physical counterpart of a human
being and could live undetected
on our worlds for the several years required
to prepare for the attack. They
were amazingly successful. Each
group of cells in the long series
which began moving towards an approximation
of the human pattern
was developed only far enough to
initiate the greatest favorable shift
possible at that point in its genetic
structure. Cell generations may have
followed each other within hours in
this manner, for over six decades.</p>

<p>"The goal of the experiment, the
last generation issued in Kalechi's
laboratories, were Satog copies of embryonic
human beings. This stage was
comprised of approximately twelve
hundred individuals who were now
permitted to mature and were
schooled individually in complete isolation
by Satog teachers. They were
indoctrinated with their purpose in
life ... the destruction of our populations ...
and trained fully in the
manner of accomplishing it.</p>

<p>"Eventually, each was shipped to a
Federation world. Cover identities as
obscure Federation citizens with
backgrounds and records had been
prepared. The final instructions given
these agents were simple. They were
to do nothing to draw attention to
themselves, make no attempt to contact
one another. They were to create
their stocks of lethal organisms, provide
methods of distribution and, on a
selected day, three Federation years
away, release the floods of death."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">The voice paused briefly, went on.
"It is a sobering reflection that this
plan&mdash;an attack by a comparatively
minor race with one specialized skill
on the greatest human civilization in
history&mdash;might very well have been
appallingly successful. But the Great
Satogs failed, in part because of the
very perfection of their work.</p>

<p>"From the human beings on board
Ohl Cantrall's captured survey ship
the Satog scientists selected Cantrall
himself and two female technicians
on his staff as the models to be followed
in developing Kalechi's pseudohumanity.
In the twelve hundred
members of the group sent to the Federation
ninety years later, these three
identity-patterns are recognizable.
They appear in varying degrees of
combination, but an occasional individual
will show only one or the other
of the three patterns involved.</p>

<p>"Ohl Cantrall was regarded as a
great man in his time, and his identification
pattern is on record. That was
the detail which first revealed the
plot. When three duplicates of that
particular pattern&mdash;and a considerable
number of approximate duplicates&mdash;turned
up simultaneously in
identification banks at widely separated
points in the Federation, it
aroused more than scientific curiosity.
Our security system has learned to
look with suspicion on apparent miracles.
The unsuspecting 'Cantralls'
were located and apprehended at
once; the threat to the Federation
was disclosed; and an intensive
though unpublicized search for the
scattered group of Kalechi agents began
immediately...."</p>

<p>The voice paused again.</p>

<p>The Satog image above the pit
vanished. A clear light sprang up in
the big room. Simultaneously, Halder
felt the nightmare immobility draining
from him and the sensation of
dreamlike unreality fade from his
mind. He turned to the right, found
Kilby's eyes already on him, saw the
Rellis couple sitting beyond her ...
Rane, no longer disguised, looking
like a mirror image of Halder.</p>

<p>They were still fastened to their
chairs. Halder's gaze shifted back
quickly to the center of the room.
Where the pit had been, the flooring
was now level, carrying a massive,
polished table. Behind the table sat a
heavily built, white-haired man with
a strong face, harsh mouth, in the formal
black and gold robes of a Councilman
of the Federation.</p>

<p>"I am Councilman Mavig." The
voice was the one that had spoken in
the dark; it came now from the man
at the table. "I am in charge of the
operation against the Kalechi agents,
and it is my duty to inform them, after
their arrest and examination, of the
disposition that must be made of
them."</p>

<p>He hesitated, twisting his mouth
thoughtfully, almost as if unwilling to
continue. "You four have been thoroughly
examined," he stated at last.
"Most of the work has been done
while you were still unconscious. A
final check of your emotional reactions
was being made throughout the
stress situation just ended, in which
you listened to a replay of a report on
the Kalechi matter. That part is now
concluded."</p>

<p>Mavig paused, scowled, cleared his
throat. "I find," he went on, "that
some aspects of this affair still strain
my credulity! More than half of your
group have been captured by now; the
remainder are at large but under observation.
The danger is past. The
activities of the Great Satogs of Kalechi
will receive our very close scrutiny
for generations to come. They
shall be given no opportunity to repeat
such a trick; nor&mdash;after they
have been made aware of the measures
we are preparing against them&mdash;will
they feel the slightest inclination
to try it.</p>

<p>"Now, as to yourselves. After we
had tracked down the first dozen or
so of you, a startling pattern began to
emerge. You were not following Kalechi's
careful instructions. In one
way and another&mdash;in often very ingenious
ways&mdash;you were attempting
primarily to establish contact with
one another. When captured and examined
while unconscious by the various
interrogation instruments of our
psychologists you told us your reasons
for doing this."</p>

<p>Councilman Mavig shook his head.
"The interrogation machines are supposed
to be infallible," he remarked.
"Possibly they are. But I am not a
psychologist, and for a long time I
refused to accept the reports they returned.
But still ..."</p>

<p>He sighed. "Well, as to what is to
happen with you. You will be sent to
join the previously arrested members
of your group, and will remain with
them until the last of you is in our
hands, has been examined, and ..."</p>

<p>Mavig paused again.</p>

<p>"You see, we can accuse you of no
crime!" he said irritably. "As individuals
and as a group, your intention
from the beginning has been to prevent
the crime against the Federation
from being committed. The Great
Satogs simply did too good a job. You
have been given the most searching
physical examinations possible. They
show uniformly that your genetic pattern
is stable, and that in no detail
can it be distinguished from a wholly
human one of high order.</p>

<p>"You appreciate, I imagine, where
that leaves the Federation! When imitation
is carried to the point of identity ..."
Federation Councilman
Mavig shook his head once more, concluded,
"It is utterly absurd, in direct
contradiction to everything we have
understood to date! You've regarded
yourselves as human beings, and believed
that your place was among us.
And we can only agree." &#9632;</p>
